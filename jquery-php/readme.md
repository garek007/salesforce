# jQuery calls to PHP and back
I set this page up mostly so I could try to get my jQuery and PHP error handling figured out. I've had problems in the past with getting generic 500 Internal Server error messages back, and that's not helpeful. What I have here is a start, I'll likely have to refer back to it and add more as I learn.
